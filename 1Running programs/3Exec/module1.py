#Programs. With the text editor of your choice, write a simple module file
#containing the single statement print('Hello module world!') and store it
#as module1.py. Now, run this file by using any launch option you like: running
#it in IDLE, clicking on its file icon, passing it to the Python interpreter on
#the system shellâ€™s command line (e.g., python module1.py), built-in exec calls,
#imports and reloads, and so on. In fact, experiment by running your file with
#as many of the launch techniques discussed in this chapter as you can. Which
#technique seems easiest? (There is no right answer to this, of course.) 


print("hello")
