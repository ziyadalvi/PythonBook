#Although numbers are primarily processed with expressions, built-ins, and modules,
#they also have a handful of type-specific methods today, which weâ€™ll meet in this chapter
#as well. Floating-point numbers, for example, have an as_integer_ratio method that
#is useful for the fraction number type, and an is_integer method to test if the number
#is an integer.
