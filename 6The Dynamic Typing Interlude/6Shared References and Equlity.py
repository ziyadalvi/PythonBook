#Python caches and reuses small integers and small strings, as mentioned earlier,
#the object 42 here is probably not literally reclaimed; instead, it will likely remain in a
#system table to be reused the next time you generate a 42 in your code

#the == operator, tests whether the two referenced objects have
#the same values; this is the method almost always used for equality checks in Python.
#The second method, the is operator, instead tests for object identityâ€”it returns True
#only if both names point to the exact same object
