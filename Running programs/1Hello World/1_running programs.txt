In general, the dot expression syntax object.attribute lets you fetch any attribute
attached to any object, and is one of the most common operations in Python code.
Here, we’ve used it to access the string variable title inside the module myfile—in
other words, myfile.title.
Alternatively, you can fetch (really, copy) names out of a module with from statements:

% python # Start Python
>>> from myfile import title # Run file; copy its names
>>> title # Use name directly: no need to qualify
'The Meaning of Life'

As you’ll see in more detail later, from is just like an import, with an extra assignment
to names in the importing component. Technically, from copies a module’s attributes,
such that they become simple variables in the recipient—
